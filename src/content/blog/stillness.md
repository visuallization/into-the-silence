  - text: "„(in our culture..) sorrow and unhappiness become a sickness one should avoid at any costs…\r\n\nIn the ancient mystery schools the importance of feelings was fully understood. However it was also understood, that only through deep and concentrated praxis would a balanced being emerge, freely able to express feelings such as love, compassion, happiness and sorrow, but with enough self control to avoid being carried away by, e.g. hate, jealousy or unbridled anger.“Lars Muhl, Gate of Light S.38, 39"
